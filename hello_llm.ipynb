        "复现 https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/08/how-to-build-chatbots-with-langchain/\n",
        "\n",
        "## 技术说明\n",
        "1. 使用OLLAMA的openai兼容接口替换掉对OpenAI的依赖\n",
        "2. 使用Facebook Faiss 替换掉对DeepLeak向量存储和查询的需要\n",
        "3. 使用OLLAMA Embedding 替换掉对Open AI Embedding 接口的依赖\n",
        "\n",
        "## 技术限制\n",
        "部分包加载后可能要重启内核！,例如nltk总是报错，需要在终端中升级并重启内核? pip install -U nltk\n",
        "\n",
        "## 学习/实验心得\n",
        "1. llama3 不支持中文\n",
        "2. llama3.1:8b 中文支持非常好\n",
        "3. 少量局部的文字/document对向量查询影响很小，特别是伪造的数据；可以通过仅仅通过新数据构建临时DB来极大提高权重(文档内容会命中，并直接进入提示词)，进而排除rag部分的问题\n",
        "4. 提示词对响应而言影响是非常巨大的！\n",
        "5. chat history 很好用\n",
        "6. 直接response和print(response)为什么显示差别那么大，不都是字符串吗？print有魔法?\n",
        "\n",
        "## 未来工程计划\n",
        "1. 增加Tools功能/尝试agentic\n",
        "2. 改造成一个完整的桌面/Web程序, Flask+React+Electron\n",
        "\n",
        "## 未来学习计划（深入理解Prompt）\n",
        "1. 深刻理解Prompt，对于基于无格式的prompt来和大模型沟通，我依然表示惊叹和有点无法接受\n",
        "2. 这种Prompt不是手写Sql一样，很容易注入吗？而且很难有效的Scale\n",

            "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Sunlight travels to Earth**: The sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, and infrared (IR) radiation.\n",
            "2. **Light enters the atmosphere**: When sunlight reaches our planet, it passes through the air molecules in the atmosphere, such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
            "3. **Scattering occurs**: As the light travels through the atmosphere, it encounters these tiny gas molecules. The smaller wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (like red and orange). This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
            "4. **Blue light is scattered in all directions**: Because blue light is scattered so efficiently, it reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Why not violet?**\n",
            "You might wonder why we don't see violet light as much as blue light. There are a few reasons for this:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Violet light is absorbed by the atmosphere**: Some of the violet light is absorbed by ozone (O3) and other atmospheric gases.\n",
            "* **Blue light has a shorter wavelength**: Blue light has a slightly longer wavelength than violet light, which makes it less prone to absorption.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Other factors that influence sky color**\n",
            "\n",
            "While scattering is the main reason for the blue sky, other factors can affect its appearance:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dust and pollution**: Tiny particles in the air can scatter light and make the sky appear hazy or gray.\n",
